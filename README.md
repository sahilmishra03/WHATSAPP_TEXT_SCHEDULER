# 💬 WhatsApp Scheduled Message Feature (Flutter + Firebase)

> 🚀 A small real-life problem turned into a smart Flutter solution!

---

## 🧠 The Story Behind This Project

As a student, I use a daily tiffin service 🍱.  
My provider asked me to send a confirmation message **every day at 5 AM** — but between college, late-night work, and irregular mornings 😴... I often forgot.  

And that meant **no tiffin for the day.**  
So, I decided to **solve my own problem using code.**

I built a **“Scheduled Message” feature** — just like WhatsApp — where you can:
- ✍️ Type a custom message  
- ⏰ Pick the exact time  
- 📤 Automatically send it to a contact at that time

# 💬 WhatsApp Scheduled Message Feature Demo (Flutter + Firebase)

> 🚀 A small real-life problem turned into a smart Flutter demonstration!

---

## 🧠 The Story Behind This Project

As a student, I use a daily tiffin service 🍱.  
My provider asked me to send a confirmation message **every day at 5 AM** — but between college, late-night work, and irregular mornings 😴... I often forgot.  

And that meant **no tiffin for the day.**  
So, I decided to **solve my own problem using code.**

I built a **“Scheduled Message” feature demo** — showing how such a feature could be integrated into WhatsApp.  
It’s a **proof-of-concept** built using **Flutter + Firebase**, demonstrating message scheduling, automation, and real-time updates.

However, in the future, we plan to use **Firebase Cloud Functions** or **background services** to trigger the message **even when the app is closed.**
